            <h3>How to prepare for your first meeting?</h3>
            <p>
              Before your first meeting, take some time to reflect on what you
              hope to achieve from therapy. Consider jotting down any questions
              or concerns you'd like to discuss with your therapist. It's also
              helpful to find a quiet, comfortable space where you can fully
              engage in the session.
